# REACT - Javascript Library for rendering User Interfaces

_UI - User Interface_

UI is built from small units like buttons, text, images

React lets you combine them into reusable and nestable _components_

1. **Components**

Components are isolated pieces of UI and are the building blocks of any react application.

They are one of the core concepts of React

A react component is a JavaScript function that may contain markup.

They can be as small as a button and as large as an entire **page**

```
function AmazingBoxes() {

    return <div className="h-24 w-24 bg-yellow-300"></div>;
}

```
