# Importing and Exporting Components

## The root component file

In Lesson One we made an **AmazingBoxes** component and a **Component** componentðŸ˜„ that renders it:

We then Imported _Component_ file from the Lesson-one Folder within the Tutorial folder to the _App.jsx_ file. This file is the root component for our app and any app scaffolded with _create-react-app_ or **vite** in our case.

## Exporting and Importing a component

In future we might want to change what appears on the landing page which by default is provided by the root component **App**

#### How to move a component

1. Make a new JS/JSX file to put the components in.
2. Export your function component from that file (using either default or named exports).
3. Import it in the file where youâ€™ll use the component (using the corresponding technique for importing default or named exports).

Just as we did in Lesson One inside the **App.jsx** file we can have the components in the _Components.jsx_ file be in different files in the Lesson Two folder, export them and Import them in the _App.jsx_ file

We now have a root file _App.jsx_ that renders children but with a cleaner file structure

```
import AmazingBox from "./Tutorial/Lesson-Two/AmazingBox";
import Component from "./Tutorial/Lesson-Two/Component";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Component />
      <div className="flex gap-2 ">
        <AmazingBox />
        <AmazingBox />
        <AmazingBox />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

We also have two separate files

1. **Component.jsx** - that has been exported

```
export default function Component() {
  return (
    <div className="mt-4 mx-2">
      <h1 className="my-4 font-semibold underline text-3xl">Amazing Boxes</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

2.  **AmazingBox.jsx** - that has also been exported

```
function AmazingBox() {
    return <div className="h-24 w-24 bg-yellow-300"></div>;
  }


  export default AmazingBox
```

## Default VS Named exports

There are two primary ways to export values with JavaScript: default exports and named exports.

Our examples are based on default exports but you can use both of them in one file

**BUT NOTE**

A file can have only **ONE** default export. A file can have more than one named export

##### Default export

```
Component.jsx
_______________________

export default function Button(){
  return (
    \\\
  )
}

```

##### Named export

```
Component.jsx
_______________________

export function Button(){
  return (
    \\\
  )
}
export function SideBar(){
  return (
    \\\
  )
}

```

##### Named export & One Default export

```
Component.jsx
_______________________

export function Button(){
  return (
    \\\
  )
}
export default function SideBar(){
  return (
    \\\
  )
}

```

How you export your component dictates how you must import it and you will get an error if you try to import a named export the way you would a default export

The table below is how you would import both exports

| Syntax  | Export Statement                      |                Import Statement |
| ------- | :------------------------------------ | ------------------------------: |
| Default | export default function Button( ) { } |   import Button from './Button' |
| Named   | export function Button( ) { }         | import {Button} from './Button' |

Default imports can have any names after the import keyword

e.g import Banana from './Button'

But named imports should maintain their names hence the word **named** imports

**Use default exports if the file exports only one component, and use named exports if it exports multiple components and values.**
